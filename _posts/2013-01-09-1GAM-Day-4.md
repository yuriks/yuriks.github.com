Today I spent most of the day travelling, so I didn't get that much done. I did implement a few things though:
* Camera system. Your view is now always centered on your ship.
* Semi-proper timing. Theoretically the game should run at a more constant speed now, though it shouldn't make a difference if your VSync was working in the first place.
* And most importantly: Ported the graphics to OpenGL 1.5. Took little effort and should massively increase compatibility.

No screenshot because there aren't any changes that would be visible on it. Get the new binary [here](/files/2013-01-10/SpaceCrawler-win32-c6170f.7z). I'd be very grateful if you test it and let me know if it works or not via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yuriks).
