So I finally got around to renovating my site infrastructure: It now uses [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) behind the scenes, instead of my own homebrewed pre-processing tool and homeserver. You can thank the [OneGameAMonth](http://onegameamonth.com/) initiative for that, I plan to post my progress updates here. Look for them in the coming days!
