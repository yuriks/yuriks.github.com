So after about a day of semi-productive work, I have a something implemented of my new game idea. Things I managed to add in this timespan are:
* Rotating player ship with inertial newtonian physics.
* A few dummy spinning enemy drones.
* Shooting bullets and their collision with the drones.

If you want to try it out, binaries can be found on the [project page](/projects/spacecrawler.html). The [source](https://github.com/yuriks/SpaceCrawler) is over at GitHub. Controls for now are arrow keys and X to shoot.

This one has been much quicker to get up to speed due to having the framework from the previous game already in place, though I had to chase a particularly annoying bug in my SpriteBuffer class that didn't manifest earlier which took me the greater part of yesterday. Frustrating.

I hope to be able to keep making progress at this rate, even though I know it won't last, specially with my university classes starting back again next week.

**Update:** People had trouble running it, so I decreased the required OpenGL version to 3.0. This should increase compatibility a bit, specially when I later compile it for other platforms. Download it on the link above.
