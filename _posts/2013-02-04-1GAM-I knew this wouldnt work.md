So classes started. And with that went the whole 1GAM thing. It may be obvious from the lack of updates I haven't really been working on it lately. I still wan't to complete my game though, so I'll march on. But the month deadline is busted.

The only new things I did since the last post were adding performance counters (to help trackdown performance hiccups on my laptop) and a fancy procedural starfield background:

Pretty nice huh?

That's it, I just wanted to post something here, the lack of updating was making me depressed.
