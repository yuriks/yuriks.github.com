		<p>Space Crawler is a game I'm working on in my spare time. It's a space combat/exploration game. The general idea is for it to be something akin to "Diablo in Space!", in that (at least some) missions will be procedurally generated and there will be many kinds of equipment to upgrade your spaceship.</p>

		<p>Since development happens in my spare time, progress is going to be slow (but hopefully steady.) You can follow its development on the <a href="/">blog section of this website.</a></p>
